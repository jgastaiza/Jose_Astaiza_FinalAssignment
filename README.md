## Description and motivation

USBankLocations.com makes public a compilation of statistics about Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios for all US banks, as well as a compilation of demand deposits statistics for each bank. These statistics are originally collected by various government agencies and USBankLocations.com obtain the data from these government agencies under the Freedom of Information Act. 

For this project I scraped those statistics, which include 6058 banks, and analyzed them using Python.  

Some questions/issues that motivated the project are:

- In the process of issuing deposits and granting loans, financial institutions transform assets characterized by short maturities, small amounts and low risks (deposits) into assets of longer maturities, greater amounts and higher risks (loans).
- Since an important fraction of the illiquid loans of banks are financed through the demand deposits of the uninformed public, then there is always the possibility that depositors excessively withdraw their deposits (i.e., the possibility of a bank run) and the bank face both a liquidity shortage and a higher probability of failure.
- Although bank runs could have a speculative cause, they could also have a fundamental cause, i.e., they could be caused by the bank asset quality.
- The tier 1 capital ratio is the comparison between a banking firm's core equity capital and its total risk-weighted assets. A firm's core equity capital is known as its tier 1 capital and is the measure of a bank's financial strength based on the sum of its equity capital and disclosed reserves, and sometimes non-redeemable, non-cumulative preferred stock. A firm's risk-weighted assets include all assets that the firm holds that are systematically weighted for credit risk.
- What do basic descriptive statistics of the data tell us about the risks of US banks?
- What do basic descriptive statistics of the data tell us about the deposits of US banks?
- Is there a clear relation between the risks and the level of deposits in the United States?

## Methods used

1. Scraping
    - For each bank, the data of demand deposits and the tier 1 capital ratios are available online in the two following websites.
        - Demand deposits:  http://www.usbanklocations.com/bank-rank/demand-deposits---totaldeposits--td-ddt.html
        - Tier 1 capital ratio: www.usbanklocations.com/bank-rank/tier-1-risk-based-capital-ratio---performanceratios--pcr-rbc1rwaj.html
    - To scrape the two websites I used the 'BeautifulSoup' library.
    - The whole Python code is available [here](FinalAssignment_Jose_Astaiza.ipynb)
<br><br>
2. Extracting the data from 'BeatifulSoup' objects:
    - Both to scrape the raw text and to extract the data from it, I wrote codes to get urls to deposits and risks; get the names of banks; remove unnecesary symbols; transform the string digits into floats; get the names sorted alphabetically mantaining for each bank the corresponding data.
<br><br>
3. Managing, storing, and further cleaning the data:
    - I created lists with the data of banks names, demand deposits and risks and furthered cleaned the data using 'Pandas' methods, regular expressions, etc.
    - I used 'Pandas' to create a data frame with the information of banks, demand deposits, log demand deposits and risks.
    - The complete database or data frame in csv format is available [here](base_completa)
    - There was an important outlier that was identified and droped using the .drop and .index methods.
<br><br>
4. Analysing data
    - I used the numpy, math and statsmodels.formula.api libraries to make mathematical operations and run statistical models.
    - Also, I used matplotlib to create figures.
<br><br>
5. Sharing the data
    - I created a blog using blogger and changed the html code to make the results avaliable and searchable to the public.

## Findings

All code for analysis is available [here](FinalAssignment_Jose_Astaiza.ipynb).
 
- Two samples were analysed: the complete sample and the sample without the outlier. This was a strange value correspondig to risk. The  risk outlier is in the position 2768 of the complete data frame and is asociated to HSBC,Delaware (36197%). It is important to notice that the second highest risk is just 868.6%.

- The descriptive statistics of the complete data base are:
