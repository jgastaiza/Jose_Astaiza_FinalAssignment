Since an important fraction of the illiquid loans of banks are financed through the demand deposits of 
the uninformed public, then there is always the possibility that depositors excessively withdraw their 
deposits (i.e., the possibility of a bank run) and the bank face both a liquidity shortage and a higher 
probability of failure. These bank runs could have a fundamental cause, i.e., they could be caused by 
the bank asset quality. See for example Karas, Pyle and Schoors (2013), Martinez-Peria & Schmukler(2010),
Flannery & Sorescu (1996). Then, I want to investigate how banks’ risks behave and how are they 
associated to deposits. 

To do so, I plan to use Beautifulsoup and Regex in Python to scrape information about banks. This 
includes scraping banks’ names, risk data and deposits data. Also, I will use Pandas so that I can have
a data base in which each bank is associated to a risk and deposit level, and if necessary I will clean
the data looking for missings or atypical values.
 
Of course, I will export the data to a .cvs file for replication.

After having the appropriate data, I plan to use mathematical, statistical and graphical packages to 
analyze the data such as math, numpy, matplotlib and others. This will help me to generate descriptive 
statistics, visualize distributions and look for linear associations between the variables.

At the end, I will be able to see how depositors are investing their money in terms of the risks that
each bank involves, and how disperse are banks in terms of risks and size, measured by deposits.
